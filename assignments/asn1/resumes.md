#### Experience

At my previous job I worked on doing web development on embedded systems, and
worked on basically everything, [from the front-end
code](https://www.micromeritics.com/Repository/Files/Envelope-Density-Report.jpg)
to the analysis code & system admin stuff for the [Geopyc
1365](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdUiYWuejVI). I worked in Python on the
backend, and Javascript/Typescript/Backbone/React on the frontend.

My current job is doing devops, as well as a bit of embedded programming, for
GTRI. I've mostly been using Python, as well as a decent amount of bash & C++.
