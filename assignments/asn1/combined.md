## Teamwork Basics

Summarize the following sections in the Teamwork Basics documents using your
own words and must provide examples using personal experience (at least two
group members) in this class or other classes or internships:

### Ground Rules: Norms 1 to norms 5

Setting some ground rules can help clearly lay out what to and what not to do
when working on assignments or communicating with the team.

1. **Work norms**: Who will do what and when is it due? Will anyone review it?

  - These rules are the basis for completing any group assignment and must be
    made clear because not making these clear can make some members think the
    deadline is a different date or two members could do the same part.

2. **Facilitators Norms**: Will you use facilitators?

  - Facilitators are people who will keep the team on track. They are the
    person who will chime in "Ok so what we are doing isâ€¦" clarifying the
    objective or "Guys if we finish this part now, we can go home early"
    motivating the group to stay on track.

    I had a groupmate in my system-level class that was like that. Having a
    person clarifying what we did the last meet and what we needed to do during
    this one was beyond helpful.

    We were working on a library checkout program and sometimes during the
    meetings the group, myself included, would over focus on one small part of
    the assignment, like the book properties. She would always get the team to
    focus on the requirements, and asked people in the group who weren't
    enthusiastic about the project for their input to keep them engaged.

3. **Communication Norms**: How will the group communicate? Email, GroupMe,
   etc.?

  - Having everyone in a group chat can be helpful to facilitate
    communication. It can also help pass along the assignments to the leader.

4. **Meeting Norms**: When is a good time to meet and where? What if someone
   misses a lot of meetings?

  - These can help provide structure because in previous groups when one person
    is not going to meetings you can tell them that the times are clearly laid
    out. Without it they probably felt no consequence because there was no
    clarification in the beginning that not going would be met with telling the
    professor or asking for a grade reduction.

5. **Consideration Norms**: Can people eat at meetings or smoke? Is everyone
   comfortable with the other team members?

  - It's important to make sure everyone is comfortable, and it can help those
    teammates who are shy and may only provide input if the environment is not
    intimidating.

### Goals

It's important to make sure that the whole team is on the same page with
regards to the goal. If one teammate is only concerned with passing and getting
a C or above and other members are working for an A, there will be conflict
which should have been addressed from the beginning.

### Hints for Handling Difficult Behavior

If a teammate is too talkative, it can be due to their eagerness or they want
to show off their knowledge to the group. If they can't take a hint that other
people would like to provide input, then you can use humor to stop them from
dominating the situation, or alternatively you can talk to them privately about
letting others provide an equal amount of input.

If they are too quiet then you can make an effort to ask them questions about
themselves and tell them you appreciate any input they give. It is likely that
they have good ideas for the project because they have been listening the whole
time.

If the person is very aggressive and critical then you should evaluate their
critiques and then ask them privately to tone down their actions, as they are
having a negative effect on the rest of the team.

If a teammate complains a lot, evaluate the complaints and make changes to
resolve those complaints. If it is not possible to do so, then talk to them to
try to resolve their problem in another way.

### Hints for Handling Group Problems

The whole group may come across problems that affect all members.

If the team is floundering and not really getting anything accomplished getting
a list of tasks can be very helpful. In my experience, someone taking up the
leadership role can help provide the group with needed direction.

When the team is constantly getting distracted and going on tangents you can
ask for an explaination of a certain part of the project in order to discretely
get the group on topic.

If the group makes decisions too quickly then you can ask things like "Are we
all in agreement about this?" to slow things down, and provide more time to
find an optimal solution.

If the group fails to come to a consensus, then multivoting may be a way to
finally make a decision. Multivoting is listing the choices and having members
rate them from best to worst and find similarities in the best ideas and try to
combine them.

If team members are fighting between themselves, then take a break and use the
techniques from [Hints for Handling Difficult behavior][].

If someone is being ignored or ridiculed then they will not be able to provide
the team with input. Therefore, all members must make a extra effort to be
inclusive and make everyone feel accepted.

When a group member doesn't want to do their share of work, then it's necessary
to talk to them and list the consequences of their actions. Hinting at this is
insufficient, it's important for things to be fully explained to ensure they
fully understand. Not being direct could get them to not like you and resist
doing the work even more.
## Problem Statement

### What is your product, on a high level?

Our product is an online banking application, which will allow the customers of
a bank or other another financial institution to perform money-management
without physically visiting the bank.

It will allow the customers to open their accounts, manage them electronically,
to monitor them, to make transactions, pay their bills, transfer money, make
deposits, and so on.

### Whom is it for?

An online banking application is beneficial to everyone but is especially
useful for those people with a stringent work schedule. It will help them to
manage their accounts and keep track of their activities in a quick manner with
minimal costs without the need to to visit a physical bank during working hours
or make a phone call.

### What problem does it solve?

 - 24/7 availability, saving the customer from rushing the banks during working
   hours. With an online banking system, people can perform their tasks at a
   time that suits their work schedule.

 - Stringent schedules, where customers with strict working hours
   to perform their banking activities effectively and conveniently.

 - Centralized source of information, where instead of visiting different
   officials specialized in different tasks, the customer can use an online
   banking application flexible enough to do any task in a single click. Human
   bankers are not always availible, but the application always will be,
   meaning there is no need to rush to the bank to get things done.

 - Remain informed: With the online banking system, customers can easily
   receive up-to-date information regarding their upcoming deadlines or dues
   through notifications, emails, or text messages.

 - Easy bill payments, so that there is no need to rush to the bank. Everything
   can be done at home instead.

### What alternatives are available?

 - Services provided by 3rd party application, like Mint
 - A phone app
 - In person banking services
 - Phone calls
 - ATMs

### Why is this project compelling and worth developing?

 - It would reduce costs for banks by reducing the amount of human labor
   required.
 - An electronic banking system would enable banks to keep stringent records
 - A computerized ledger would reduce the number of mistakes when calculating
   interests, making transactions, and so on.
 - It whould increase customer satisfaction because they would have access
   to our banks from any place with WiFi.

### Describe the top-level objectives, differentiators, target customers, and scope of your product.

- Objective: To create a product that performs to our requirements and have it
  sustainable for multiple lifecycles.
- Differentiators: Our system wonâ€™t sell data to any third parties, have no
  hidden transaction fees, and will not participate in predatory lending
  practices
- Target customers: Our target customer is the average citizen, anyone that
  currently uses or will use a bank for their transaction needs.
- Scope: The scope of our project is building an online business ledger, making
  a database to store our information, developing a web app and making a UI for
  our customers.

### What are the competitors and what is novel in your approach?

Our competitors are Finacle, nCino, Oracle, etc. What we bring new to the table
is that our system will be entirely online. Additionally, our platform is
customer focused and will be fully transparent. We won't sell customer data or
charge hidden fees.

### Make it clear that the system can be built, making good use of the available resources and technology.

Our system is possible because it will be very simplistic and direct. Clients
will connect to our application software where they will be greeted by a
user-friendly interface, which will primarily be coded in HTML, with CSS used
to create a beautiful design for our clients. Finally, the frontend of our
application will be connected to a backend SQL database. The database will be
responsible for recording transactions such as withdrawals, deposits, bill
pays, and more.

### What is interesting about this project from a technical point of view?

The project will use a client-server architecture in order to be accessible to
clients from anywhere.

Emphasis will also be placed on graphical design, using our creativity to design
a nice interface for our clients.
